## CODE

***

### Purpose

The goal of the file is to expand on the code found in the `utility` folder, as well as their related unit tests.  Ideally, it will explain to you why the code is as it is, why I ignored specific cases, and why I tested what I did.  It will be broken into two sections:  `utility` and `tests`, to reflect the folders that the code can be found in.



### Utility
