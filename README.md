# Data Analysis Combo Repository

This is the combined repository for the three data analysis projects based on [phyphox](https://phyphox.org).
Even though these are INDIVIDUAL projects you can (but don't have to) share code related to phyphox.

## Gyroscope
1. Record data of a periodic motion.
2. Derive the physical model.
3. Write your own fitting algorithm to fit the data.

## Magnetometer
1. Record data of a periodic chamge of a magnetic field.
2. Derive the physical model.
3. Write your own fitting algorithm to fit the data.

## GPS
1. Record data of a location change.
2. Derive the physical model for that location change.
3. Write your own fitting algorithm to fit the data.
